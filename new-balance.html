                    <h3>Concept</h3>
                    <p>
                        Literature reviews and archival research was conducted to understand the roots of the brand; how it developed from a humble sole supplier to the independent giant we know of today, as well as the design process behind how their silhouettes and signature colourway came about.
                        <br><br>
                        This process pushed for a direction that involved photography as it related closer to the streetwear “hypebeast” sneakerhead culture.
                        <br><br>
                        Art direction was conducted by myself; props included in the set were fabricated and sourced specifically for this shoot.

                    <p>The result is a scene that studies the brand and product through 13 different ways of understanding and visualising what New Balance means to its customers and the community as a larger whole, building on the legacy that has been continuously moulded through the decades.</p>
